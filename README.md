journal-gateway-zmtp
====================

Now with substantially more swoosh!

A ZeroMQ gateway for sending logs from systemd's journald over the network and a
sink.

Logs are stored in a journalfile, separated for each source.

```
Build and Installation
----------------------

You will need [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software) (recomended
version: 3.2.5, you'll need >= 3),
[czmq](https://github.com/zeromq/czmq#toc3-71)  (ZeroMQ C bindings), jansson
and the systemd-headers (for the gateway only). The gateway and the client can
be build seperately (thus you dont need systemd for the client). Using Fedora
you can do:

```bash
yum install jansson jansson-devel systemd-devel
```

for jansson and systemd. To install ZMQ and CZMQ follow the instructions on
the linked sites.


Then just execute (in the journal-gateway-zmtp directory):

```bash
make              # you can also just build the gateway or the client
                  # with 'make source' or 'make sink'
```

If you wish to use additional compiler flags you can insert them via the
environment variable EXTRA_CFLAGS or EXTRA_LDFLAGS for linking.

To install the files into your system, you can call the install script in
/sample

Usage
-----

### gateway-sink

You should start the sink first. It binds to the specified socket and waits for
an incomming connection from a gateway. If you want it to stay listening for
more than one connection, you should start it with the --listen flag.

You can start the sink via:
```bash
env JOURNAL_REMOTE_DIR=[some_path] GATEWAY_LOG_PEER=[some_peer] ~/dev/tobzmq/journal-gateway-zmtp-sink --listen
```

You must specify a peer (in GATEWAY_LOG_PEER) on which the sink binds and
expects sources to log on. You must also specify a directory (in
JOURNAL_REMOTE_DIR) in which you want to save your remote journals. The journal
file names are based on the IDs of the gateways. Every new gateway-sink
connection will be logged in the journal:

```bash
MÃ¤r 02 09:58:42 virtual-fedora-sbs journal-gateway-zmtp-sink[9623]: gateway has a new source, ID: 006B8B4567
```

### gateway-source

Installing the gateway will also install a service file to execute the gateway
as a systemd unit:

```bash
systemctl start journal-gateway-zmtp-source    # connects by default to "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555"
```

The service looks for a configuration file named "zmq_gateway_source.conf" in
the directory "~/conf". You can change the socket there (this only has an
effect, if you execute the gateway as a systemd unit).

If you want to start the gateway without using systemd, you can type
```bash
env JOURNAL_REMOTE_TARGET=[some_peer] JOURNAL_SOURCE_DIR=[some_path] ~/dev/tobzmq/journal-gateway-zmtp-source
```

where JOURNAL_REMOTE_TARGET defines the exposed socket of the sink and
JOURNAL_SOURCE_DIR the target socket for the logs.

Use --help for an overview of all commands.

### usage with systemd service files

If you used the install script ``sample/install.sh`` two systemd service files
will be located in your ``/lib/systemd/system/`` folder

* journal-gateway-zmtp-source.service
* journal-gateway-zmtp-sink.service

and two so called systemd environment files will be located in your
``/etc/`` folder

* journal-gateway-zmtp-source.conf
* journal-gateway-zmtp-sink.conf

The ``.conf`` files will be read by the ``.service`` files. By changing the
 ``.conf`` files you can control

for the source:
* the directory in which journal-gateway-zmtp-sink will store received logs
* the port which journal-gateway-zmtp-sink will hold open and receive logs on
* the port on which journal-gateway-zmtp-sink will listen for control signals
* how old a journal file can be before it is deleted by rotation
* how much space can be used by journal files

for the sink:
* the port to which journal-gateway-zmtp-source will send the logs
* the directory from which the journal-gateway-zmtp-source will read the logs
* the port on which journal-gateway-zmtp-source will listen for control signals

To start the systemd ``.service`` simply call one or both of the following

```
systectl start journal-gateway-zmtp-sink
systectl start journal-gateway-zmtp-source
```

For more info on systemd service files see [systemd's documentation](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html)

Configuration with systemd environment filters
----------------------------------------------

Configuration while Running
---------------------------

###Enhanced Control for the ZMTP-Journal-Gateway

To enable configuration of both sink and source during runtime the following API
and connection is implemented. Both parts of the gateway expose a port on which
a tool can connect via ZeroMQ. The gateway offers the journal-gateway-zmtp-
control which is a simple one line input tool. Both expect a json encoded string
which contains a json_object (a dictionary of key-value pairs) with only one
pair. The key contains the command and the value contains the arguments if any.
The sink/source then checks if the command matches one of the valid commands.
The source of the control command then receives a message: If succesfully
matched the command gets executed and CTRL_ACCEPTED or the requested information
is returned (for example a list of all connected logging sources is returned
from the sink). If the match failed CTRL_UKCOM is returned.

```

It follows a list of all valid commands:

* help
    - will show a short version of this chapter

* show_exposed_port
    - will show the endpoint chosen in GATEWAY_LOG_PEER if not otherwise set
    - this is the port on which the logs sent by the source are received

* set_exposed_port <port>
    - will set the endpoint
    - Example: set_exposed_port tcp://127.0.0.1:5555

* show_sources
    - will show the zmq ids of each connection to journal-gateway-zmtp-sources

* show_log_directory
    - will show the directory in which the journal files are stored

* set_log_directory <dir>
    - will set the directory
    - will create the directory if it doesn't exist at the time of the call
    - Example: set_log_directory /var/log/example/

* show_diskusage
    - shows the used disc space of the directory in which the logs are stored
    - the shown number is the number of used blocks

* shutdown
    - will stop the sink

The following commands will change the applied filters.
This is implemented in a set and commit manner, meaning that the changes you choose will only apply after you commit them.
The filters have to be written in the same way ``journalctl`` expects the matches (FIELD=value).
The filters are applied in the sources, changing the filters in the sink will lead to a broadcast of the new filters to all sources, changing the filters globally.

* filter_add FIELD=value
    - will add the matching FIELD=value to the filters
    - successively added filters are ORed together
    - Example: filter_add PRIORITY=4

* filter_add_conjunction
    - will add a logical AND to the list of filters

* filter_flush
    - will drop all currently set filters

* filter_show
    - will show the currently set filters
    - will also show the currently active filters

* filter_commit
    - will apply the currently set filters
    - WARNING: will set the same filter on **every** source

This chapter contains short explanation for each command one can send to the journal-gateway-zmtp-source.

* help
    - will show a short version of this chapter

* show_target_port
    - will show the endpoint chosen in JOURNAL_REMOTE_TARGET if not otherwise set

* set_target_port <port>
    - will set the endpoint
    - Example: set_target_port tcp://127.0.0.1:5555

* show_log_directory
    - will show the directory from which the logs are read

* set_log_directory <dir>
    - will set the directory from which the logs are read

* shutdown
    - will stop the source

The handling of the filters in the source is the same as in the sink.

Example
-------

Start the sink:
```bash
env JOURNAL_REMOTE_DIR=~/logtest GATEWAY_LOG_PEER=tcp://127.0.0.1:5555 ~/dev/tobzmq/journal-gateway-zmtp-sink --listen
```
Start the source:
```bash
env JOURNAL_REMOTE_TARGET=tcp://127.0.0.1:5555 JOURNAL_SOURCE_DIR=/var/log/journal ~/dev/tobzmq/journal-gateway-zmtp-source
```

This will write everything in your journal into a journal file in the specified directory.
```bash
journalctl --directory ~/logtest -f
```

Planned Features
----------------

* simpler filter communication between sink & source
* configuration via actual .conf files instead of environment variables
